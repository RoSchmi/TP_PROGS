### RWCPM

This is an application in Turbo Pascal 5.0 to run under DOS. It was written in 2021.
The binaries will only run under DOS.

The application is based on a program from 1986

The program is used to copy files from 5 1/4'' CP/M-86 diskettes (IBM-Format 8 Sec/Track, 40 Tracks, singlesided)
to 5 1/4'' DOS Diskettes

Copying fom CP/M to DOS works on a c't-86 DIY computer and perhaps should work on other IBM-PC compatible too.
The program is 'quick' (haha) and dirty and not thoroughly tested.
